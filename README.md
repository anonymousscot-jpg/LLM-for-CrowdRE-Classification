# LLM-for-CrowdRE-Classification

This repository provides Jupyter notebooks and resources to replicate experiments on **software requirement classification** using **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.

The workflow includes categorizing LLMs, preparing requirement datasets, and running classification experiments either locally or in Google Colab.

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before running the notebooks, please ensure you have completed the following:

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anonymousscot-jpg/LLM-for-CrowdRE-Classification.git
   cd LLM-for-CrowdRE-Classification
   ```

2. **Create and activate a Python virtual environment**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Mac/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Prepare datasets**
   Place the following files in the project’s **root directory**:

   * `Open source llms-2.csv`
   * `requirements.csv`

##  Step-by-Step Experiment Workflow

The experiment is divided into three main notebooks. **Run them in order.**

---

### **Step 1: Create LLM Size Categories**

* **Notebook:** `llm_classification.ipynb`
* **Purpose:** Categorizes LLMs into five size groups: *Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Ultra*.

**How to Use**

1. Open the notebook.
2. Run all cells sequentially.

**Expected Output**

* Scatter plot visualizing clusters.
* Categorized list of LLMs with assigned size categories.

---

### **Step 2: Prepare the Software Requirements Dataset**

* **Notebook:** `data.ipynb`
* **Purpose:** Processes raw CrowdRE dataset into a clean format.

**How to Use**

1. Open the notebook.
2. Run all cells.

**Expected Output**

* `requirements_merged.csv`
* `requirements_merged_cleaned.csv`
* `Data_for_llm.zip` (to be used in the next step)

---

### **Step 3: Run the Main Classification Experiment**

You have **two options** depending on your environment:

---

#### **Option A: Run on Google Colab**

* **Notebook:** `llm_crowdRE_Colab.ipynb`

**Instructions**

1. Run **Cell 1**: Installs Ollama and pulls models. *(Large downloads, requires stable internet & disk space)*
2. Run **Cell 2**: Upload `Data_for_llm.zip`.
3. Run **Cell 3**: Starts classification.

You will be prompted to choose the experiment type:

* Binary
* Tertiary
* Quaternary
* Quinary

---

#### **Option B: Run Locally**

* **Notebook:** `llm_ondevice.ipynb`

**Prerequisites**

* Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) on your machine.
* Pull the required model:

  ```bash
  ollama pull phi4-mini-reasoning:3.8b
  ```

**Instructions**

1. Open the notebook.
2. Update the `csv_path` inside the `Config` class to point to your `requirements_merged_cleaned.csv`.
3. Run all cells.

---

## 📊 Expected Results

After running the classification:

* A directory named `classification_results` (or similar) will be created.
* Inside, you’ll find:

  * `comprehensive_report.html` → Detailed performance metrics, charts, and analysis.
  * `summary_results.csv` and `detailed_results.csv` → Tabular results for further analysis.
  * `experiment_log.json` → Raw output logs.

⚠️ **Note:** Running the classification is computationally intensive and may take several hours.
